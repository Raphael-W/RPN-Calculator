# RPN Calculator
This is a calculator which uses RPN to evaluate expressions. RPN was popular in older calculators because it eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules. While this calculator doesn't let you directly type in RPN, you can see it convert it to RPN first before evaluating it.
